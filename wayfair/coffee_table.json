Rustic pecan and white ash burl veneers are paired with rustic maple solids showcasing the aura of fine craftsmanship that is implicit in every design. Conveying authenticity with the hand-rubbed black finish to the mix of glass, hand forged iron, and leather-wrapped cases, this collection makes a statement.   Grand in size and demeanor, Costa del Sol expresses its origins through a variety of aging techniques - rasp, rock, worm hole, hand-scoring and chiseling -all of which lend the loving looks of years passed. Coupled with the rustic Cordova finish, melding darkened edges and straw highlights, the collection's aesthetic is inescapably one of warmth and emotion.   Of course, it is the smallest details that make the biggest statement. Costa del Sol recognizes this as well. From a grand bail and rosette, to a door knocker and knobs, each replete with Spanish influences, the accents on each design speak to the collection's deepest belief - that your lifestyle awaits amidst Costa del Sol's distinctive villa-inspired world.\n\nFeatures\n\nCosta Del Sol collection\nTwo drawers\nWood construction\nDark woodtone finish\n\n\n\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nBase Material:  Wood\n\n\nHidden Storage Compartment:  Yes\n\n\nExterior Shelves:  No\n\nLegs Included\n\nLeg Type:  Queen Anne Legs\n\n","859.0":"Castered bunching cocktail table with pull-through drawer  (1\/ctn). \n\nFeatures\n\nOak Veneer over poplar solids\nCollection: Hamilton\nIncludes one end table\n\n\n\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nBase Material:  Wood\n\n\nExterior Shelves:  Yes\n\n","86.0":"High-performing Edition (A Member of the 100 Collection) is cleverly designed to mix and match, making it easy to create the perfect set-up for living space.
