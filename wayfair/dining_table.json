Please always keep in mind that wood breaths and absorbs moisture. Chemicals\u00a0such as nail polish, nail polish remover, alcohol (rubbing and drinking kind) and even water may leave marks if not attended to immediately. To\u00a0prevent damage always use protective pads under drinks, hot plates and clean up spills quickly with a soft slightly damp cloth in the direction of the\u00a0wood grain. Do not place plastic, rubber or other objects on wood furniture for this may discolor finish. Always use felt, cork or leather under any accessories. Cleaning should be done on a weekly basis to remove dust by using a soft cloth in the direction of the wood grain. A high quality, non-silicone\u00a0furniture polish can also be used. Always avoid oily polishes and waxes. A more through cleaning should be done bi annually by washing with a mild soap that is intended for furniture care and please follow their\u00a0directions carefully. Do not wash wood tops (bar surfaces, table tops, etc.) with wet rags or other materials and allow product to air dry. This will damage wood and wood\u00a0veneers and void all warranties. Please remember liquid in glass, cups, or center pieces can sweat leaving ring marks on wood surfaces. This will not be covered under our warranty. \u00a0Always keep wood surfaces dry and use protective mats under said items.\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  Manufacturer guarantee issued for 1 year from date of invoice\n\n"],"36":["\nFeatures\n\nRusic top constructed entirely from solid acacia\nUn-planed surfaces are lightly sanded to preserve natural depth variances and saw marks from the milling process\nMulti-step finish uses a rustic glaze and rich oak stain\nMatte NC lacquer top coat\nGray powder-coated steel base\nSeats 6 to 8\nTable rustic truffle\nExclusively ours\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nBase Material:  Metal\n\n\nLeaf Included:  No\n\n\nSeating Capacity:  8\n\n\nTable Base Type:  Four leg\n\n"],"37":["\nFeatures\n\nSolid Wood Furniture: The Montreal Dining Collection is constructed from Solid Rubberwood.\nNo MDF or Partical Board: Does not contain these inferior components that are found in most furniture today.\nKiln-Dried Hardwood: This process establishes Moisture Content Uniformity and prevents warping, cracking, and splitting.\n\n9-step Finish: The Rich Cognac Finish is a deep brown with a slight reddish undertone that adds depth and warmth to this collection.\nVersatility: The Mariposa Dining Collection offers functional solutions to entertain medium to large gatherings.\n(3) 24\" Self-Storing Leaves\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nBase Material:  Wood\n\n\nSolid Wood Construction:  Yes\n\n\nLeaf Included:  Yes\n\n\nSeating Capacity:  10\n\n\nTable Base Type:  Four leg\n\n"],"38":["\nFeatures\n\nTraditions collection\nFrame material: Acacia veneer\nIron fittings\nIncludes 2 leaf\nRecommended to use the costers and place mats when necessary, and wipe down any spill right away\nLeaves are not self-storing leaves, the leaves have to store seperately\nManufacturer provides 1 year warranty\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nBase Material:  Wood\n\n\nLeaf Included:  Yes\n\n\nSeating Capacity:  8\n\n\nTable Base Type:  Four leg\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n"],"39":["\nFeatures\n\nMade of solid rubberwood and birch veneers\nWipe clean with a damp cloth\nImported\nIncludes one 18-inch leaf\nManufactured in US\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nLeaf Included:  Yes\n\n"],"40":["\nFeatures\n\nSet includes pub table and four saddle stools\nLeaf Included: No\nConstructed of wood\nChair Material: Wood\nSolid Wood Construction: No\nScratch Resistant: No\nRust Resistant: No\nSeating Capacity: 4\nTable Height: Counter (35\"- 36\" H)\nExtension: No\nAdjustable: No\nUpholstered Barstools- Vinyl: No\nUpholstered Barstools- Leather: No\nUpholstered Barstools- Fabric: No\nSwivel Barstools: No\nOutdoor Barstools: No\nBarstools With Back: No\nBarstools With Arms: No\nCurated Collection: No\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nBase Material:  Wood\n\n\nLeaf Included:  No\n\n\nSeating Capacity:  4\n\n\nTable Base Type:  Four leg\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe clean with a dry cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n"],"41":[],"42":["\nFeatures\n\nSolid pine construction.\nDust with a clean, dry cloth.\nImported\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nBase Material:  Wood\n\n\nSolid Wood Construction:  Yes\n\n\nLeaf Included:  Yes\n\n\nSeating Capacity:  8\n\n\nTable Base Type:  Legs\n\n\nProduct Care:  Dust with a clean, damp cloth.

conditions such as being placed next to A\/C or heating outlets or open windows. \u00a0It\u00a0is also best to avoid direct sunlight for this may fade certain finishes. Please always keep in mind that wood breaths and absorbs moisture. Chemicals\u00a0such as nail polish, nail polish remover, alcohol (rubbing and drinking kind) and even water may leave marks if not attended to immediately. To\u00a0prevent damage always use protective pads under drinks, hot plates and clean up spills quickly with a soft slightly damp cloth in the direction of the\u00a0wood grain. Do not place plastic, rubber or other objects on wood furniture for this may discolor finish. Always use felt, cork or leather under any accessories. Cleaning should be done on a weekly basis to remove dust by using a soft cloth in the direction of the wood grain. A high quality, non-silicone\u00a0furniture polish can also be used. Always avoid oily polishes and waxes. A more thorough cleaning should be done bi annually by washing with a mild soap that is intended for furniture care and please follow their\u00a0directions carefully. Do not wash wood tops (bar surfaces, table tops, etc.) with wet rags or other materials and allow product to air dry. This will damage wood and wood\u00a0veneers and void all warranties. Please remember liquid in glass, cups, or center pieces can sweat leaving ring marks on wood surfaces. This will not be covered under our warranty. \u00a0Always keep wood surfaces dry and use protective mats under said items.\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  Manufacturer guarantee issued for 1 year from date of invoice\n\n"],"531":["\nFeatures\n\nMade using mango wood from old mango trees that have stopped bearing fruitful harvests and have been cleared to make room for young mango trees on certified sustainable plantations\nSquare shape\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nBase Material:  Metal\n\n\nLeaf Included:  No\n\n\nSeating Capacity:  8\n\n\nTable Base Type:  Double pedestal\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"532":["\nFeatures\n\nTable top injected with polypropylene\nHigh resistance anodized aluminum legs\nPowder coated metal structure\nUV Protection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Metal; Other\n\n\nBase Material:  Metal\n\n\nLeaf Included:  No\n\n\nSeating Capacity:  6\n\n\nTable Base Type:  Four leg\n\n\nProduct Care:  Do not clean under high pressure.

For light dirt please note the following handy tips: It is better to put the furniture polish on the rag rather than directly on the wood. The furniture polish may remove light gray haze, refreshes the surface structure (vein) and generates a protective layer against touch and fingerprints. By using a smaller amount of furniture polish blotchy stains can be avoided. Try to keep the air moisture on a constant level for instance by using a small water reservoir put next to your heater.
