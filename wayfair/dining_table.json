Please always keep in mind that wood breaths and absorbs moisture. Chemicals\u00a0such as nail polish, nail polish remover, alcohol (rubbing and drinking kind) and even water may leave marks if not attended to immediately. To\u00a0prevent damage always use protective pads under drinks, hot plates and clean up spills quickly with a soft slightly damp cloth in the direction of the\u00a0wood grain. Do not place plastic, rubber or other objects on wood furniture for this may discolor finish. Always use felt, cork or leather under any accessories. Cleaning should be done on a weekly basis to remove dust by using a soft cloth in the direction of the wood grain. A high quality, non-silicone\u00a0furniture polish can also be used. Always avoid oily polishes and waxes. A more through cleaning should be done bi annually by washing with a mild soap that is intended for furniture care and please follow their\u00a0directions carefully.

heat, humid conditions such as being placed next to A\/C or heating outlets or open windows. \u00a0It\u00a0is also best to avoid direct sunlight for this may fade certain finishes. Please always keep in mind that wood breaths and absorbs moisture. Chemicals\u00a0such as nail polish, nail polish remover, alcohol (rubbing and drinking kind) and even water may leave marks if not attended to immediately. To\u00a0prevent damage always use protective pads under drinks, hot plates and clean up spills quickly with a soft slightly damp cloth in the direction of the\u00a0wood grain. Do not place plastic, rubber or other objects on wood furniture for this may discolor finish. Always use felt, cork or leather under any accessories. Cleaning should be done on a weekly basis to remove dust by using a soft cloth in the direction of the wood grain. A high quality, non-silicone\u00a0furniture polish can also be used. Always avoid oily polishes and waxes. A more thorough cleaning should be done bi annually by washing with a mild soap that is intended for furniture care and please follow their\u00a0directions carefully. Do not wash wood tops (bar surfaces, table tops, etc.) with wet rags or other materials and allow product to air dry. This will damage wood and wood\u00a0veneers and void all warranties. Please remember liquid in glass, cups, or center pieces can sweat leaving ring marks on wood surfaces. This will not be covered under our warranty. \u00a0Always keep wood surfaces dry and use protective mats under said items.\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  Manufacturer guarantee issued for 1 year from date of invoice\n\n","531.0":"\nFeatures\n\nMade using mango wood from old mango trees that have stopped bearing fruitful harvests and have been cleared to make room for young mango trees on certified sustainable plantations\nSquare shape\n\n\n\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nBase Material:  Metal\n\n\nLeaf Included:  No\n\n\nSeating Capacity:  8\n\n\nTable Base Type:  Double pedestal\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n","532.0":"\nFeatures\n\nTable top injected with polypropylene\nHigh resistance anodized aluminum legs\nPowder coated metal structure\nUV Protection\n\n\n\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Metal; Other\n\n\nBase Material:  Metal\n\n\nLeaf Included:  No\n\n\nSeating Capacity:  6\n\n\nTable Base Type:  Four leg\n\n\nProduct Care:  Do not clean under high pressure.

For light dirt please note the following handy tips: It is better to put the furniture polish on the rag rather than directly on the wood. The furniture polish may remove light gray haze, refreshes the surface structure (vein) and generates a protective layer against touch and fingerprints. By using a smaller amount of furniture polish blotchy stains can be avoided. Try to keep the air moisture on a constant level for instance by using a small water reservoir put next to your heater.

We also recommend periodically putting your leaves into the table allowing them to age naturally to match the color of the rest of the table.\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  1 year limited\n\n","566.0":"\nFeatures\n\nRustica collection\nIncludes a leaf extension\n\n\n\nProduct Details\n\nLeaf Included:  Yes\n\n\nSeating Capacity:  4\n\n\nTable Base Type:  Pedestal\n\n","567.0":"\nFeatures\n\nOval shape\nMDF, solid wood, stainless steel and natural walnut veneer construction\nOtago collection\nHigh gloss shiny lacquer finish\n1 Year warranty\n\n\n\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Wood; Manufactured wood\n\n\nBase Material:  Manufactured wood; Metal; Wood\n\n\nSeating Capacity:  6\n\n\nTable Base Type:  Pedestal\n\n","568.0":"\n\n                  Overall: 40\" H x 21.5\" W x 25\" D\n                \n\n                  Seat Upholstery Material: Cotton; Microfiber\n                \n\n                  Overall Product Weight: 26.05lbs\n                \n\n\n\n                  Rustic Traditions collection\n                \n\n                  French and English dovetail construction\n                \n\n                  Full extension metal side drawer glides\n                \n\n                  Bottom case dust proofing\n                \n\n                  Felt lined top drawer\n                \n\n\n\n                  Includes: headboard,footboard and rails\n                \n\n                  Requires a box spring, not included\n                \n\n                  Finish: Antique Ivory\n                \n\n                  English dovetail construction\n                \n\n                  Full extension metal side drawer glides\n                \n\n\n\n                  Desk Type: Computer desk\n                \n\n                  Overall: 30.5\" H x 44\" W x 22\" D\n                \n\n                  Assembly Required: Yes\n                \n\n                  Top Material: Wood\n                \n\n                  Base Material: Wood\n                \n\n\n\n                  Keaton collection\n                \n\n                  X style trestle base\n                \n\n                  Zinc metal top\n                \n\n                  Trestle base\n                \n\n                  Color:Deep brown\n                \n\n\n\n                  Wall Mounted: No\n                \n\n\n\n                  The nail heads are a dark gun metal colorUpholstered chair\n                \n\n                  Leg dining table: 30\" H x 38\" W x 72\" D, 117.06 lbs\n                \n\n                  Side chair: 39\" H x 20\" W x 20\" D, 18.07 lbs\n                \n\n\n\n                  English dovetail construction\n                \n\n                  Requires a box spring, not included\n                \n\n                  3 Drawer nightstand\n                \n\n                  Full extension metal side drawer glides\n                \n\n                  Full stained interior drawers\n                \n\n\n\n                  Overall: 30\" H x 66\" L x 102\" L x 40\" W\n                \n\n                  Product Warranty: 1 Year\n                \n\n                  Top Material: Wood; Manufactured wood\n                \n\n                  Base Material: Manufactured wood; Wood\n                \n\n                  Overall Product Weight: 161lbs\n                \n\n\n\n                  Town and Country collection\n                \n\n                  Metal ball bearing glide system\n                \n\n                  Made of rubberwood solids and white oak veneer\n                \n\n                  Self storing\/removable leaf\n                \n\n                  Planked top\n                \n\n\n\n                  Upholstered chair\n                \n\n                  Includes an 18\" leaf\n                \n\n                  Material: Oak veneers\n                \n\n                  Finish: Merlot\n                \n\n                  Satin nickel nail head trim chair\n                \n\n\n\n                  Listing includes the island and 4 chairs.

To\u00a0prevent damage always use protective pads under drinks, hot plates and clean up spills quickly with a soft slightly damp cloth in the direction of the\u00a0wood grain. Do not place plastic, rubber or other objects on wood furniture for this may discolor finish. Always use felt, cork or leather under any accessories. Cleaning should be done on a weekly basis to remove dust by using a soft cloth in the direction of the wood grain. A high quality, non-silicone\u00a0furniture polish can also be used. Always avoid oily polishes and waxes. A more through cleaning should be done bi annually by washing with a mild soap that is intended for furniture care and please follow their\u00a0directions carefully. Do not wash wood tops (bar surfaces, table tops, etc.) with wet rags or other materials and allow product to air dry. This will damage wood and wood\u00a0veneers and void all warranties. Please remember liquid in glass, cups, or center pieces can sweat leaving ring marks on wood surfaces. This will not be covered under our warranty. \u00a0Always keep wood surfaces dry and use protective mats under said items.\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  Manufacturer guarantee issued for 1 year from date of invoice\n\n","350.0":"\n","351.0":"The AmeriHome Square Adjustable Bar Table makes a great addition to your kitchen, bar, game room, or basement.\n\nFeatures\n\nRotating table top\nPolished chrome base\nSquare diameter table top\nTextured vinyl covering on tabletop\nCapacity: 200 lbs\nFinish: Black vinyl top\nAmeriHome collection\n\n\n\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Other\n\n\nBase Material:  Metal\n\n\nLeaf Included:  No\n\n\nSeating Capacity:  2\n\n\nTable Base Type:  Pedestal\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  90 Days Limited\n\n","352.0":"\n\nFeatures\n\nFinish: Natural, Clear Coated\nMaterial: Iron, Reclaimed Teak\nSeats up to 6\nHandmade\n\n\n\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nBase Material:  Metal\n\n\nLeaf Included:  No\n\n\nSeating Capacity:  6\n\n\nTable Base Type:  Pedestal\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n","353.0":"You want your home to be a retreat.

For light dirt please note the following handy tips: It is better to put the furniture polish on the rag rather than directly on the wood. The furniture polish may remove light gray haze, refreshes the surface structure (vein) and generates a protective layer against touch and fingerprints. By using a smaller amount of furniture polish blotchy stains can be avoided. Try to keep the air moisture on a constant level for instance by using a small water reservoir put next to your heater.

''I wanted to clear up the slum of legs.'' Thus in 1957 Saarinen unveiled his ground-breaking collection of pedestal coffee, dining and side tables, whose simple elegance has endured for 50 years. Stylish and modern, the Saarinen Oval Dining Table is a design masterpiece that fits seamlessly into any environment. Eero Saarinen might be considered by some to be a purist when it came to his approach towards architecture and interior design. He sought the essential idea and reduced it to the most effective structural solution within an overall unity of design. When he designed his pedestal collection, including the Oval Dining Table, Saarinen realized his ideal of formal unity: ''Every significant piece of furniture from the past has a holistic structure.'' To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Saarinen's revolutionary Tulip Collection, Knoll has introduced a reintroduced teak and rosewood tabletop finishes.\n\nFeatures\n\nEach authentic Knoll product is stamped with the Knoll Logo and designer signature and includes a certificate of authenticity\nBase made of heavy molded aluminum\nShould you discover shortly after receiving your Saarinen Table that parts are either damaged or missing, please call us immediately, and we will be happy to send you replacement parts as soon as possible and at no additional cost\nTransparent polyester coat helps prevent use-associated stains\nBase is strap-polished and coated in tough, abrasion-resistant rilsan finish\nPlease note that marbles with polyester coating will yellow over time\nMade in the United States\nSustainable design is a key component of Knoll's environmental focus. Knoll's commitment to social responsibility and a healthy environment has prompted the company to further articulate its longstanding environmental programs and, with encouragement and support from colleagues in the industry, Knoll has re-energized its focus on such ''green'' initiatives as life cycle analysis and LEED#174 certification. Knoll is proud to have contributed to projects that have received LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.
