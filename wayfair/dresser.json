Radiata pine is an extremely strong wood, with a beautiful finish. Pine has a high resin content that gives it its strength, but can also cause slight blemishing in the finish. Knots, slight hairline cracks close to the knots, and small imperfections in the pine are part of the nature of this type of pine. Discovery World has stringent guidelines on the amount and size of knots that are located in areas where strength is of the utmost importance (bed rails, ladders, etc.). Some of these imperfections are caused by expansion and contraction due to environmental factors, and once in your home, will not worsen. Solid wood will not fail, even with extreme moisture, but one should expect to see minor acceptable defects due to the natural expansion and contraction of the product in a warehouse, in transit, and in your home. For those looking for a great fit, a deep natural finish, that may have natural imperfections but will last a lifetime, we recommend a solid wood product.","355":"Our Coal Harbor bedroom collection has an urban and sophisticated style making it ideal for contemporary, transitional and eclectic decor.

including knots, mineral streaks, and sap runs that may affect the appearance of the finish. These variations are not defects; they are distinctions that make each piece of furniture unique. Broyhill applies a multi-step finish on all of our wood furniture to enhance the beauty of the woods surface. This finishing process uses lacquer-based products that are subject to damage by moisture, heat, or contact with alcohol-based and oil-based products. Take care of the multi-step finish Broyhill gives each piece and you\u2019ll preserve the inherent beauty of your fine furniture. You can preserve your furniture by protecting your furniture and dusting frequently with a clean, damp lint-free cloth to remove abrasive buildup which can damage the finish over time. Occasionally polish with a high-quality non-silicone furniture polish every few months to enhance the beauty of the multi-step finish; spray the polish onto a clean cotton cloth, apply it to the furniture, and then buff with a second clean, dry cotton cloth. Touch up small marks and scratches with a marker, scratch remover, or touch-up stick.\n\n"],"88":["\nFeatures\n\nVintage inspired hardware\nDecorative bun feet\nFive drawers with solid joint\nFrame

These variations are not defects; they are distinctions that make each piece of furniture unique. Broyhill applies a multi-step finish on all of our wood furniture to enhance the beauty of the woods surface. This finishing process uses lacquer-based products that are subject to damage by moisture, heat, or contact with alcohol-based and oil-based products. Take care of the multi-step finish Broyhill gives each piece and you\u2019ll preserve the inherent beauty of your fine furniture. You can preserve your furniture by protecting your furniture and dusting frequently with a clean, damp lint-free cloth to remove abrasive buildup which can damage the finish over time. Occasionally polish with a high-quality non-silicone furniture polish every few months to enhance the beauty of the multi-step finish; spray the polish onto a clean cotton cloth, apply it to the furniture, and then buff with a second clean, dry cotton cloth. Touch up small marks and scratches with a marker, scratch remover, or touch-up stick.\n\n"],"321":["\nFeatures\n\n6 Practical drawers with elegant aluminum handles\nMetal slides for smooth gliding\nAccessories not included\nClean, straight lines, for a contemporary style\nNew and improved drawer bottom made with wood fibers\nBack surface is not laminated\nManufactured from certified environmentally preferred laminated particle panels\nFront drawers have a luxurious black lacquer finish\nMikka collection\n5 Years limited\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe clean with a dry cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  5 Years limited\n\n"],"322":["\nFeatures\n\nKingston Isle collection\nContemporary style\n6 Drawers\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n"],"323":["\nFeatures\n\nHardwood construction\nReverserible PU and wood panel drawer fronts\nCustom clover hardware with acyrlic inset\nBall bearing drawer glides\nParis collection\n1 Year warranty\nInclude 2 drawers on the inside bottom and 3 open spaces on the top\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing; Jewelry\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  1 Year Manufactureres Defects Warranty\n\n"],"324":["\nFeatures\n\nCedar in bottom drawer\nPearl essence finish\nSanctuary collection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood; Manufactured wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe clean with a dry cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  1 Year\n\n"],"325":[],"326":["\nFeatures\n\nWeathered wood\nNumber of drawers: 6\nMaterial: Wood\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n"],"327":["\nFeatures\n\nAntique white with rub through highlights\nPewter rings and decorative plates\nCenter guided metal drawer glides with plastic drawer stops drawers\nDust proofing on bottom drawers for added protection\n14.5\" Front to back and the top drawer has a felt bottom for your finer things\nBeautiful wood molding with mitered corners drawers\nFramed end panels\nTip resistant furniture bracket for added safety\nHardwoods and veneers construction\nEnglish dovetail construction with solid wood sides and backs drawers\nTenon and mortis construction\nDistressed finish\nHeirloom collection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe Clean with damp cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  1 year warranty\n\n"],"328":["\nFeatures\n\nFive drawers adorned with beautiful clear crystal knobs\nProfiled corners and decorative moldings\nScalloped bottom edge\nConstructed from engineered wood products\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe clean with a dry cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  5 Years\n\n"],"329":["\nFeatures\n\nRite-trac drawer glide with stop\nCasual contemporary style\nMade in the USA\nVeneer and hardwood solid construction\nHamilton Franklin collection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood; Manufactured wood\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"330":["\nFeatures\n\nHand beveled arched mirrors\nHidden compartments for storage of valuables and jewelry\nBrass utility\/power unit for cord and telephone plug in\nTwo jewelry felt lined tray with brass lock and key\nEasy bolt together system for appearance of single wall system\nAromatic cedar lined compartments\nFrench dovetail drawer joinery prevents separation of drawer front from box\nDip stained and spray sealed to keep moisture out and prevents cracking\nNorthern red oak construction\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"331":["\nFeatures\n\nIdeal solution for generous storage and updated style in the bedroom\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe clean with a\u00a0dry cloth.

Radiata pine is an extremely strong wood, with a beautiful finish. Pine has a high resin content that gives it its strength, but can also cause slight blemishing in the finish. Knots, slight hairline cracks close to the knots, and small imperfections in the pine are part of the nature of this type of pine. Discovery World has stringent guidelines on the amount and size of knots that are located in areas where strength is of the utmost importance (bed rails, ladders, etc.). Some of these imperfections are caused by expansion and contraction due to environmental factors, and once in your home, will not worsen. Solid wood will not fail, even with extreme moisture, but one should expect to see minor acceptable defects due to the natural expansion and contraction of the product in a warehouse, in transit, and in your home. For those looking for a great fit, a deep natural finish, that may have natural imperfections but will last a lifetime, we recommend a solid wood product.\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  Discovery World Furniture provides one year limited warranty\n\n"],"419":["\nFeatures\n\nFinish: White\nInclude antique brass metal handles\nMaterial :Wood veneers or thin slices of wood\nDrawer:  6.5\" H x 29\" W x 16\" D\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"420":["\nFeatures\n\nCare and cleaning instructions enclosed in each piece\nHigh quality laminate engineered wood\nScratch resistant finish\n1 Year warranty\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  1 year manufacturer's warranty\n\n"],"421":["\nFeatures\n\nRite-trac drawer glide with stop\nCasual lifestyle\nMade in the USA\nVeneer and hardwood solid construction\nHamilton Franklin collection\nMirror is not included\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood; Manufactured wood\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"422":["\nFeatures\n\nRite-trac drawer glide with stop\nCasual lifestyle\nMade in the USA\nVeneer and hardwood solid construction\nHamilton Franklin collection\nDrawers have full extension\nThe mirrors are ordered separately \n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood; Manufactured wood\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"423":["\nFeatures\n\nSolid wood and veneers\nWakefield Collection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nProduct Care:  Dust with a soft cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  1 Year limited manufacturer's warranty\n\n"],"424":[],"425":[],"426":["\nFeatures\n\nSix drawers and two open compartments for media storage\nDark Merlot finish\nSignature collection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe clean with a damp cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"427":["\nFeatures\n\nFull extension ball bearing drawer glides\nSanded & stained solid wood drawer boxes with dovetail joinery and felt lined top drawer\nSatin Nickel drawer pulls add a contemporary touch\nSophisticated transitional design\nDrawer boxes and wood frames are corner blocked to ensure rigidity and lasting quality\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood; Wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe clean with dry cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  1 year warranty\n\n"],"428":["\nFeatures\n\nNickel finish hardware\nRich, espresso, cherry finish\nGlide-free double ball bearing glides for smooth opening and closing\nInterior drawers are snag free wood and have been sealed for a clean, fresh appearance\nRoma collection\nIncluded Allen Wrench tools needed for assembly\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing; TV; Media\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  1 year\n\n"],"429":["\nFeatures\n\nFrench dovetail\nVinza oak and madison cherry color finish\nTraditional yet timeless look\nWood products with simulated wood grain laminates\nCleans easily with a soft cloth\nSteelwood collection\nRoller side drawer guides\nMay contain some plastic parts\nMade in the USA\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nProduct Care:  Clean with a soft cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  Standard Furniture Manufacturing Co., Inc. warrants first party purchasing from Standard that, for a  period of one (1) year from the date of delivery of the item in question by Standard to the reseller, Standard will, at its option, repair, replace or refund the purchase price, for any product manufactured by Standard that is defective in materials or workmanship.

These variations are not defects; they are distinctions that make each piece of furniture unique. Broyhill applies a multi-step finish on all of our wood furniture to enhance the beauty of the woods surface. This finishing process uses lacquer-based products that are subject to damage by moisture, heat, or contact with alcohol-based and oil-based products. Take care of the multi-step finish Broyhill gives each piece and you\u2019ll preserve the inherent beauty of your fine furniture. You can preserve your furniture by protecting your furniture and dusting frequently with a clean, damp lint-free cloth to remove abrasive buildup which can damage the finish over time. Occasionally polish with a high-quality non-silicone furniture polish every few months to enhance the beauty of the multi-step finish; spray the polish onto a clean cotton cloth, apply it to the furniture, and then buff with a second clean, dry cotton cloth. Touch up small marks and scratches with a marker, scratch remover, or touch-up stick.\n\n"],"442":[],"443":["\nFeatures\n\nFive drawers\nConstructed of plantation grown rubberwood (no rainforest lumber used)\nDrawers are dove tail construction with Euro-glides and come with both wood and pewter knobs\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  10 Years\n\n"],"444":["\nFeatures\n\nFull extension side drawer guides\nWarm Tobacco Brown finish\nAged Pewter pulls hardware color\nSonoma collection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  TV\n\n\nProduct Care:  Clean with a soft cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  1 Year\n\n"],"445":["\nFeatures\n\nToffee bedroom dresser\nMid-century modern look\nMDF and Rubberwood\nThree easy-glide drawers\nPlatform leg base\nToffee bedroom dresser mirror\nTracy collection\n1 Year warranty\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood; Manufactured wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nProduct Care:  No\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n"],"446":["\nFeatures\n\nPainted finish\n8 Drawers\nCoastal Living Retreat collection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"447":["\nFeatures\n\nBlack finish\nNantucket collection\nSnag-free finished drawer interiors\nFelt lined top drawers\nConstructed with select veneers and hardwoods\nDovetail drawer construction\nReinforced corner block drawer bottoms\nCenter metal drawer glides\nDust proof bottom drawers\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood; Manufactured wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n"],"448":["\nFeatures\n\nDrawers with metal runners and safety stops\nDetailing includes solid wood knobs\nFinish: Soft White\nPogo collection\nMade in the USA\n5 Year warranty\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nProduct Care:  Clean with damp cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  5 years\n\n"],"449":[],"450":["\nFeatures\n\nThis solid wood product is constructed from Acacia, a sustainable timber known for rich contrasting colors and pronounced grain pattern\nClean-lined modern styling with all solid wood construction, mortise and tenon corners and a vintage finish\nDistressed brick brown finish uses wire brushing and rustic glaze to create the warm patina of reclaimed wood\nSimple rectangular bar pulls feature soft edges (1 mm radius) a dark oil rubbed bronze finish\nSanded & stained solid wood drawer boxes with English joinery ensure rigidity and lasting quality; top drawers are felt lined for storing valuables\nFrame-and-panel construction, dowel joinery, and tongue-and-groove joinery ensure structural integrity; all wood is kiln dried for added strength and lasting beauty\nSide-mount full extension, ball bearing drawer glides for smooth, quiet operation and ample weight capacity\nFrame, top, side and front panels are Acacia solid wood; drawer boxes are veneer core hardwood plywood;  back panel is MDF, an engineered wood known for exceptional uniformity which ensures the product's structural integrity over time\nPlease keep in mind that natural wood must breathe and is affected by environmental conditions.

These variations are not defects; they are distinctions that make each piece of furniture unique. Broyhill applies a multi-step finish on all of our wood furniture to enhance the beauty of the woods surface. This finishing process uses lacquer-based products that are subject to damage by moisture, heat, or contact with alcohol-based and oil-based products. Take care of the multi-step finish Broyhill gives each piece and you\u2019ll preserve the inherent beauty of your fine furniture. You can preserve your furniture by protecting your furniture and dusting frequently with a clean, damp lint-free cloth to remove abrasive buildup which can damage the finish over time. Occasionally polish with a high-quality non-silicone furniture polish every few months to enhance the beauty of the multi-step finish; spray the polish onto a clean cotton cloth, apply it to the furniture, and then buff with a second clean, dry cotton cloth. Touch up small marks and scratches with a marker, scratch remover, or touch-up stick.\n\n"],"744":["\nFeatures\n\nSix drawers\nPewter rings and escutcheons hardware\nFour sided\nEnglish dovetail front and back\nDouble guide on wide drawers\nDust panels on bottom and top drawers are felt lined\nConstructed of hardwoods, veneers, tenon and mortis\nDistressed black finish\nHeirloom collection\nManufacturer provides 1 year warranty\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  TV; Clothing\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe Clean with damp cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  1 year warranty\n\n"],"745":["\nFeatures\n\nMelbourne collection\nLight wire brush finish\nFrench and english dovetail drawer construction\nFelt lined top drawer\nFinish: French truffle\nBall bearing metal drawer glides\nTypes of wood: Plantation mahogany solids and okoume veneer\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  6 Months\n\n"],"746":[],"747":["\nFeatures\n\nHand crafted from real solid birch plywood with birch wood veneer edging\nFive large drawers for storing your clothing\nMetal glides on drawers for smooth operation, butt-ended drawer box construction\nDeep interior drawer clearance\nFinger grooves below the drawers\nContemporary design blends well with any bedroom\nBuilt to last a lifetime\nMade in USA\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood; Manufactured wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  1 Year\n\n"],"748":["\nFeatures\n\nChesterfield collection\nPoplar solid and mahogany veneer\n6 Storage drawers\nDrawer bottoms cedar lining\nFully finished back panel\nProtective floor glides and center support leg\nDurable hangman anti-tip kit included\nDovetail drawer construction with full extension drawer guides\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"749":["\nFeatures\n\nMenorca ivory finish\n3 Drawers\nStarfish shaped drawer pulls\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Metal; Wood; Manufactured wood\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"750":["\nFeatures\n\nContemporary style\nBlack\nFive drawers\nClassic molding, clean lines, square tapered feet\nSmooth tops with simple classic molding edge\nConstructed of tropical hardwoods and veneers\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood; Wood\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"751":["\nFeatures\n\nAmericana collection\nShaped, carved design\nAged worn look\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood; Manufactured wood\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n"],"752":["\nFeatures\n\nMaterial: Cherry veneer and solid hardwood\nCenter metal drawer glide with stopper\nDovetail drawer construction\nHand rubbed finish\nRenaissance Collection\nthe dresser comes assembled\n4 Drawers\n1 Year warranty\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  TV\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe with a soft cloth moistened with lemon oil polish or lukewarm water\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"753":["\nFeatures\n\nSeven French dovetail drawers at the front and English at the back\nDoor at center\nWood construction\nBlack finish\nBennett collection\nManufacturer provides one year limited warranty\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nStorage Function:  Clothing\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe with a damp cloth and use a mild soap if necessary and then dry after cleaning.
