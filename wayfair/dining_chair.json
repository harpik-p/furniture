The Masters Chair (2010) weaves together the back silhouettes of Jacobsen's Series 7Chair, the Eameses' Molded Plastic Chair and Saarinen's Tulip Armchair to create something entirely new. Lightweight and durable, the Masters Chair has a wide, roomy seat, while the back rest allows you to feel supported on a historic level as it echoes the lines of the very first ergonomic innovators. The iconoclastic Starck has been working with Kartell since the 1980s, mixing the company's desire to develop eco-friendly, contemporary plastic furniture with the designer's unmistakably edgy and innovative style. Stackable up to four high. Made in Italy. The Masters chair is a powerful tribute to the three symbolic chairs, re-read and re-interpreted by the creative genius of Starck. The \"Series 7\" by Arne Jacobsen, the \"Tulip Armchair\" by Eero Saarinen and the \"Eiffel Chair\" by Charles Eames interweave their unmistakable silhouettes into a sinuous hybrid giving life to a fusion of original and engaging styles. On its four slim legs, the Masters chair is roomy and comfy. The special finish on the chair makes it feel sensual and velvety to the touch. The back of the chair is naturally its most distinctive feature, characterised by the fullness and empty spaces created by the curvaceous criss-crossing lines of three different backs which descend to meet at the seat edge. The Masters is light, practical and can be stacked and used outdoors as well. The Masters chair was honoured with the prestigious \"2010 Good Design Award\" presented by the Chicago Athenaeum - Museum of Architecture and Design.\n\nFeatures\n\nMaterial: Modified batch-dyed polypropylene\n\n\n\nProduct Details\n\nStyle:  Modern\n\n\nPrimary Material:  Plastic\n\n\nCushion Included:  No\n\n\nSwivel:  No\n\n\nStacking:  Yes\n\n\nFolding:  No\n\n","865.0":"\n\nFeatures\n\nPolyester microfiber fabric upholstery\nTapered leg\nSlim arms and tapered wood legs\nMade in USA\nHardwood solid and hardwood laminate frame construction\nCandlelight finish\nManufacturer provides limited lifetime warranty for frame and spring\nManufacturer provides one year warranty for fabric\n\n\n\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nNumber of Items Included:  1\n\n\nWeight Capacity:  300lbs\n\nUpholstered Seat\n\nSeat Upholstery Material:  Polyester\/Polyester blend\n\n","866.0":"For centuries, rattan furniture has been praised for its elegant style, long lasting construction, and aesthetic appeal.

The enduring forms and quality construction make the Molded Plastic Chairs - available here with a classic Eames wire base - comfortable, durable performers....New materials, especially those that held promise for doing more with less, fascinated Charles and Ray Eames throughout their careers. Their fascination led to inventive modern furniture, such as the Molded Plastic Chair. Designed in 1948, it was the first plastic chair to be mass produced....The current models look exactly the same as the originals. They remain un-upholstered, in keeping with the Eameses requirement that materials be expressed honestly and un-self consciously. In fact, these were the first one-piece plastic chairs to be left uncovered    At the same time, the chairs are better than ever. For example, the shell is now manufactured using more environmentally friendly, high-impact plastic.\n\nFeatures\n\nOrganic shape\nClean, simple form sculpted to fit the body\nFirst presented at the Museum of Modern Art in 1948, the chairs have achieved a pervasive presence that proves the staying power of good design\nToday's recreation looks the same as the original\nClassic Eames wire base\nDurable design, even in public spaces\nMany uses in the home, office, reception area, or training room\nDesigned for minimum environmental impact\nShells are recyclable polypropylene\nRubber shock mounts where shell meets the base provide extended comfort\nThoughtful Engineering; Shell is dyed throughout so colors remain vibrant even after years of hard use\nWayfair backs a 12-year warranty.
