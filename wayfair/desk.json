","637":"The product you are buying is solid pine wood, made of Radiata pine. Radiata pine is an extremely strong wood, with a beautiful finish. Pine has a high resin content that gives it its strength, but can also cause slight blemishing in the finish. Knots, slight hairline cracks close to the knots, and small imperfections in the pine are part of the nature of this type of pine. Discovery World has stringent guidelines on the amount and size of knots that are located in areas where strength is of the utmost importance (bed rails, ladders, etc.). Some of these imperfections are caused by expansion and contraction due to environmental factors, and once in your home, will not worsen. Solid wood will not fail, even with extreme moisture, but one should expect to see minor acceptable defects due to the natural expansion and contraction of the product in a warehouse, in transit, and in your home. For those looking for a great fit, a deep natural finish, that may have natural imperfections but will last a lifetime, we recommend a solid wood product.","638":null,"639":"Inspired by the kathy ireland Home\u2122 Architectural Style Guide\u2122, Tribeca Loft Black is a lifestyle design consistent with urban furniture trends.
