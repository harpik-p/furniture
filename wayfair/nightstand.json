Never allow water or damp items to sit on your furniture including cleaning cloths, sponges, etc. Never allow alcohol-based products including some cleaners, nail polish and perfumes to come in contact with your wood furniture. They can dissolve the furniture finish on contact, requiring professional repairs. Do not allow plastic, including plastic or rubber placemats or rubberized feet on appliances, to come in direct contact with your furniture. Chemicals in the plastic may soften and injure the finish if exposed over a long period of time. Avoid direct sunlight, heat outlets, open windows, and dampness. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can fade the finish of your furniture, while extreme temperature and humidity changes can cause cracking or splitting. Dust frequently with a clean, damp lint-free cloth to remove abrasive buildup which can damage the finish over time. Occasionally polish with a high-quality non-silicone furniture polish every few months to enhance the beauty of the multi-step finish. Spray the polish onto a clean cotton cloth, apply it to the furniture, and then buff with a second clean, dry cotton cloth. Note that any polish may make a low sheen finish appear more glossy. Additionally, it is important to avoid oily polishes and waxes.\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"211":["\nFeatures\n\nOak veneers construction\nAged Patina finish\nBrownstone Village collection\nDrawer extenders are made of full ball bearing metal\n3 Drawers, outlet in back of case\n\n"],"212":["\nFeatures\n\nPark Avenue II collection\nMaterial :Rubberwood solids, cherry veneers, and mdf particle board\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  1 Year\n\n"],"213":["\nFeatures\n\nMade from PEFC Certified sustainable wood\nISTA 3A Certified\nContemporary style\nAria collection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe with a damp cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  3 Year\n\nExterior Shelving Included\n\nNumber of Exterior Shelves:  1\n\n"],"214":["\nFeatures\n\nTouch lighting\nConstructed of acacia solids and veneers\nCorsica collection\n3 Drawers including a felt lined top drawer and cedar lined bottom drawer\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood;

Never allow water or damp items to sit on your furniture including cleaning cloths, sponges, etc. Never allow alcohol-based products including some cleaners, nail polish and perfumes to come in contact with your wood furniture. They can dissolve the furniture finish on contact, requiring professional repairs. Do not allow plastic, including plastic or rubber placemats or rubberized feet on appliances, to come in direct contact with your furniture. Chemicals in the plastic may soften and injure the finish if exposed over a long period of time. Avoid direct sunlight, heat outlets, open windows, and dampness. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can fade the finish of your furniture, while extreme temperature and humidity changes can cause cracking or splitting. Dust frequently with a clean, damp lint-free cloth to remove abrasive buildup which can damage the finish over time. Occasionally polish with a high-quality non-silicone furniture polish every few months to enhance the beauty of the multi-step finish.

Rustic Cedar uses only the finest cedar to create furniture that lasts for generations. It is naturally resistant to decay, insect and weather damage. Because of this superior resistance, cedar is frequently used for outdoor fencing, and siding on homes. Cedar has an exceptionally high strength-to-weight ratio, which means that it is both durable and easy to move about. It does not shrink or wrap as many other woods commonly do. Unlike pressure-treated wood furniture, Rustic Cedar uses no chemical preservatives that may be harmful to your family's health. \nAll cedar log furniture is subject to the natural process of checking as the wood ''seasons.'' Checking occurs as wood releases moisture across or through the annual growth rings and it does not affect the structural performance or integrity of the wood. Therefore cracks in Cedar furniture are quite normal and can happen at any time. The cracks can vary in sizes but are sure to not affect the quality or resistance of the product as this is a natural process of Cedar furniture.\nManufacturer's 5 year limited warranty\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe clean with dry cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  5 Year\n\nExterior Shelving Included\n\nNumber of Exterior Shelves:  1\n\n"],"868":["\nFeatures\n\nDrawers and a shelf provide plenty of bedside storage\nSolid birch construction\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe clean with a cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  5 years\n\n"],"869":["\nFeatures\n\nHardwood solid and veneer construciton\nReceptacle\nCedar-lined bottom drawer\nGrandover collection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood; Wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Manufactured wood; Wood\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe clean with a dry cloth\n\n"],"870":["\nFeatures\n\nIntricate resin carvings\nDovetail drawers\nSolid hardwood and veneer construction\nDistressed cherry finish\nHannah collection\nManufacturer provides 6 months limited warranty against product defects\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood; Wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  6 month limited\n\n"],"871":["\nFeatures\n\nCasa Blanca collection\nMar resistant white washed laminate and faux marble laminate top featuring the exclusive ultra gloss UV finish\nAntique brass finished hardware\nSmooth operating steel roller glide drawer runners\nStyle: Traditional\nMade in the USA\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe clean with a dry cloth.

Never allow water or damp items to sit on your furniture including cleaning cloths, sponges, etc. Never allow alcohol-based products including some cleaners, nail polish and perfumes to come in contact with your wood furniture. They can dissolve the furniture finish on contact, requiring professional repairs. Do not allow plastic, including plastic or rubber placemats or rubberized feet on appliances, to come in direct contact with your furniture. Chemicals in the plastic may soften and injure the finish if exposed over a long period of time. Avoid direct sunlight, heat outlets, open windows, and dampness. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can fade the finish of your furniture, while extreme temperature and humidity changes can cause cracking or splitting. Dust frequently with a clean, damp lint-free cloth to remove abrasive buildup which can damage the finish over time. Occasionally polish with a high-quality non-silicone furniture polish every few months to enhance the beauty of the multi-step finish. Spray the polish onto a clean cotton cloth, apply it to the furniture, and then buff with a second clean, dry cotton cloth. Note that any polish may make a low sheen finish appear more glossy. Additionally, it is important to avoid oily polishes and waxes.\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"906":["\nFeatures\n\nWhite lacquer and chrome accents\nSeville collection\nLeft facing\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nTop Material:  Glass\n\n"],"907":["\nFeatures\n\nCally collection\nCrafted entirely from solid pine for the classic farmhouse look\nSanded and stained solid wood drawer boxes with front and rear English dovetail joinery for maximum rigidity and lasting quality\nFull extension, ball bearing drawer slides for smooth, efficient operation and ample weight capacity\nRoughhewn planks of varying depths are carefully sanded and laminated to preserve natural saw marks and inconsistencies from the milling process\nHand finished with an exclusive process that uses stain, glaze and a low-sheen lacquer to permanently seal the lumber in a freshly milled condition\nTrimmed with heavy round knobs in a distressed bronze finish\nDovetail joinery ensures structural integrity\nPlease keep in mind that natural wood must breathe and is affected by environmental conditions\nFrame, top, side, front and drawer boxes are solid pine; drawer bottoms are hardwood plywood; back panel and dust covers are hardwood plywood\nFinish color is a true medium brown that runs as dark as ebony where the glaze catches or as light as car\nExpect to see shrinkage or expansion and plank movement over time, normal occurrences that will not affect the structural integrity of the piece\nAll wood is kiln dried for added strength and lasting beauty\nDust cover under bottom drawer\n1 Year warranty\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe clean with a damp cloth.\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  1 year\n\n"],"908":["\nFeatures\n\nDistressed\nWood and metal construction\nMirage collection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Metal; Wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n"],"909":["\nFeatures\n\nEncased with a rustic brown metal\nTinted drawers with English dovetail in the front and the back\nFelt lined top drawer\nSealed for dust proofing\nHardwood solids with pine veneers, fabric and antique pewter hardware constructions\nDistressed pine finish\nMuirfield collection\nManufacturer provides 1 year warranty\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood; Wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe with a damp cloth and use a mild soap if necessary and then dry after cleaning.

Never allow water or damp items to sit on your furniture including cleaning cloths, sponges, etc. Never allow alcohol-based products including some cleaners, nail polish and perfumes to come in contact with your wood furniture. They can dissolve the furniture finish on contact, requiring professional repairs. Do not allow plastic, including plastic or rubber placemats or rubberized feet on appliances, to come in direct contact with your furniture. Chemicals in the plastic may soften and injure the finish if exposed over a long period of time. Avoid direct sunlight, heat outlets, open windows, and dampness. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can fade the finish of your furniture, while extreme temperature and humidity changes can cause cracking or splitting. Dust frequently with a clean, damp lint-free cloth to remove abrasive buildup which can damage the finish over time. Occasionally polish with a high-quality non-silicone furniture polish every few months to enhance the beauty of the multi-step finish. Spray the polish onto a clean cotton cloth, apply it to the furniture, and then buff with a second clean, dry cotton cloth. Note that any polish may make a low sheen finish appear more glossy. Additionally, it is important to avoid oily polishes and waxes.\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n"],"984":["\nFeatures\n\nTraditionally styled bracket foot features gadrooned lobes and acanthus scroll carving\nCathedral cherry and exotic avoider veneers construction\nWarm pomegranate finish\nOld World collection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Other\n\n\nAssembly Required:  No\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  1 Year\n\n"],"985":["\nFeatures\n\nFinish: Black\nMaterial: Wood\nContemporary style\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n"],"986":["\nFeatures\n\nHeavy duty, full extension drawers\nElectrical power charging station in nightstand drawer with four outlets\nConstructed from solid pine and pine veneer\nAccented English dovetail drawer construction for lasting durability\nRough sawn espresso finish\nPewter finished hardware\nHaven collection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n"],"987":["\nFeatures\n\nFelt lined top drawers add a  simple touch of sophistication\nRich cherry finish\nSunset Suites collection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n"],"988":["\nFeatures\n\nDecorative crossfire grain pattern paired with sleek glossy black for a modern retro flavor\nClean drawer fronts\nSquare case profiles and simple base cut-outs to emphasize its sophisticated contemporary features\nMade in the USA\nOpen panel construction, quality engineered wood products, and simulated wood grain laminates with a high sheen finish\nVibrant medium cherry color\nEclipse collection\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nProduct Care:  Clean with a soft cloth\n\n\nAssembly Required:  Yes\n\n\nProduct Warranty:  Standard warrants the product for a period of one year from the date of delivery of the item.\n\n"],"989":["\nFeatures\n\nNot harmful for humans and pets\nAttention to detail, optimizing wood use\nHand made by craftsmen following smart design techniques\nSustainable, eco-friendly\nDrawers all run on top of the line steel\nDrawer runners are under mount, concealed under the drawer, soft self closing, full extension heavy duty Tandem, Blumotion, guaranteeing superior function as well as looks\nBanging drawers shut is no longer an issue\nDrawers close discreetly and items inside stay in place\nDrawer interiors are smooth wood surfaces, no roughness or saw dust\nHudson collection\nMade in the USA\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Wood\n\n"],"990":["\nFeatures\n\nReal wood with premium veneers and hardwood solids\nNo particle board\nFive step finishing and lacquering process\nCedar top drawer\nFull extension glides\nBirch drawer boxes\nBrass pulls\nWith keyboard pullout tray\nStyle: Traditional\nLifetime warranty\nMade in the USA\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Metal\n\n\nTop Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n"],"991":["\nFeatures\n\nNova collection\nMar resistant black and grey laminate finish\nBlack nickel finished hardware\nSmooth operating steel roller glide drawer runners\nStyle: Transitional\nMade in the USA\n\n","\nProduct Details\n\nFrame Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nTop Material:  Manufactured wood\n\n\nProduct Care:  Wipe clean with a dry cloth.
